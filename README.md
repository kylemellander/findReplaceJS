# _Find & Replace_

##### _A javascript tool to find and replace in a phrase, September 11, 2015_

#### By _**Kyle Mellander**_

## Description

_A simple web application that allows a user to input a phrase, a word they want to replace, and a word that they will replace it with.  It can replace special characters and words regardless of case.  The functionality also replaces words that are in other words, so be careful when replacing words like "the" because it will be replaced in "there".  But have fun with it!_

## Setup

* _`$ git clone https://github.com/kylemellander/findReplaceJS.git` into your computer_
* _Open `index.html` in the root folder in a web browser.
* _Enjoy!_

## Technologies Used

* _Written in javascript & jQuery_
* _Frontend with html5, css, and bootstrap_
* _Error checking with MochaJS and ChaiJS_
